ðŸ§® Calculator App (Tkinter + Command Line)

This project is a simple Python-based calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can be used as both a graphical (Tkinter) calculator and a command-line calculator.

Overview

The calculator provides a clean and minimal interface for performing quick calculations. It includes a display area for entering and viewing expressions, along with buttons for digits and arithmetic operators.

In addition to the graphical interface, the same file can be run from the command line to perform calculations directly without opening the GUI window.

Features

Graphical user interface built using Tkinter

Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Command-line mode for quick calculations

Error handling for invalid expressions

Simple, lightweight, and beginner-friendly design

Requirements

Requires Python 3 or above.
No external libraries are needed, as Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python.

Usage

GUI Mode:
Run the script normally to open the calculator window. Use the buttons to enter numbers and operators, press "=" to calculate, and "C" to clear the display.

Command-Line Mode:
You can also run the calculator with an expression as an argument to evaluate it directly in the terminal.

Customization

The window size and layout can be easily adjusted in the script. The calculator is designed to be simple and can be extended to include more operations or visual styling.
